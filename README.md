Describe my experience of using GitHub (good or bad) and describe how it might be useful to me (either personally or professionally).

Using GitHub has been interesting. It took some time to understand how to add, commit, and push changes, but now I feel more comfortable with these commands. I know that lots of companies use it for projects so it's great that GitHub tracks changes.
